# DevOps

DevOps is a mixture of principles, practices, and tools that allow teams to deliver higher quality software at a faster pace.

DevOps starts with culture. Teams embrace *principles* like breaking down silos, continuous improvement, automation, and 
frequent communication that improve how they deliver software. These principles *change the way people in an organization think* 
about developing and operating digital products. This influences how they work and they adopt practices that rapidly deliver 
small incremental changes. 

Tools are needed to automate and support these practices. This is why teams that embrace DevOps use tools that enable practices 
like frequent communication, CI/CD, and containerization. So, there are two sides of DevOps, the concept and the execution.
